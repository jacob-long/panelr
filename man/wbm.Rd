Default is FALSE, but some research suggests this is a better idea
(see Curran and Bauer (2011) reference).}

    than one is specified their sum is used.  See \code{\link{model.offset}}.}

\item{interaction.style}{The best way to calculate interactions in within
models is in some dispute. The conventional way (\code{"demean"}) is to first
calculate the product of the variables involved in the interaction before
those variables have their means subtracted and then subtract the mean of
the product from the product term (see Schunk and Perales (2017)).
Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran (2020) show this method carries
between-entity differences that within models are designed to model out.
They suggest an alternate method (\code{"double-demean"}) in which the product
term is first calculated using the de-meaned lower-order variables and
then the subject means are subtracted from this product term. Another
option is to simply use the product term of the de-meaned variables
(\code{"raw"}), but Giesselmann and Schmidt-Catran (2020) show this method
biases the results towards zero effect. The default is \code{"double-demean"}
but if emulating other software is the goal, \code{"demean"} might be
preferred.}

\item{scale}{If \code{TRUE}, reports standardized regression
coefficients by scaling and mean-centering input data (the latter can be

\item{scale.response}{Should the response variable also be rescaled? Default
is \code{FALSE}.}

Fit "within-between" and several other regression variants

\details{
\strong{Formula syntax}

The within-between models, and multilevel panel models more generally,
distinguish between time-varying and time-invariant predictors. These are,
as they sound, variables that are either measured repeatedly (in every wave)
in the case of time-varying predictors or only once in the case of
time-invariant predictors. You need to specify these separately in the
formula to tell the model which variables you expect to change over time and
which will not. The primary way of doing so is via the \code{|} operator.

As an example, we can look at the \link{WageData} included in this
package. We will create a model that predicts the logarithm of the
individual's wages (\code{lwage}) with their union status (\code{union}), which can
change over time, and their race (\code{blk}; dichotomized as black or
non-black),
which does not change throughout the period of study. Our formula will look
like this:

\code{lwage ~ union | blk}

Put time-varying variables before the first \code{|} and time-invariant
variables afterwards. You can specify lags like \code{lag(union)} for time-varying
variables; for more than 1 lag, include the number: \code{lag(union, 2)}.

After the first \code{|} go the time-invariant variables. Note that if you put a
time-varying variable here, what you get is the observed value rather than
one adjusted to isolate within-entity effects. You may also take a
time-varying variable --- let's say weeks worked (\code{wks}) --- and use
\code{imean(wks)} to include the individual's mean across all waves as a
predictor while omitting the per-wave measures.

There is also a place for a second \code{|}. Here you can specify cross-level
interactions (within-level interactions can be specified here as well).
If I wanted the interaction term for \code{union} and \code{blk} --- to see whether
the effect of union status depended on one's race --- I would specify the
formula this way:

\code{lwage ~ union | blk | union * blk}

Another use for the post-second \code{|} section of the formula is for changing
the random effects specification. By default, only a random intercept is
specified in the call to \code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer()}}/\code{\link[lme4:glmer]{lme4::glmer()}}. If you would like
to specify other random slopes, include them here using the typical \code{lme4}
syntax:

\code{lwage ~ union | blk | (union | id)}

You can also include the wave variable in a random effects term to
specify a latent growth curve model:

\code{lwage ~ union | blk + t | (t | id)}

One last thing to know: If you want to use the second \code{|} but not the first,
put a 1 or 0 after the first, like this:

\code{lwage ~ union | 1 | (union | id)}

Of course, with no time-invariant variables, you need no \code{|} operators at
all.

\strong{Models}

As a convenience, \code{wbm} does the heavy lifting for specifying the
within-between model correctly. As a side effect it only
takes a few easy tweaks to specify the model slightly differently. You
can change this behavior with the \code{model} argument.

By default, the argument is \code{"w-b"} (equivalently, \code{"within-between"}).
This means, for each time-varying predictor, you have two types of
variables in the model. The "between" effect is represented by the
individual-level mean for each entity (e.g., each respondent to a panel
survey). The "within" effect is represented by each wave's measure \emph{with
the individual-level mean} subtracted. Some refer to this as "de-meaning."
Thinking in a Hausman test framework --- with the within-between model as
described here --- you should expect the within and between
coefficients to be the same if a random effects model were appropriate.

The contextual model is very similar (use argument \code{"contextual"}). In
some situations, this will be more intuitive to interpret. Empirically,
the only difference compared to the within-between specification is that
the contextual model does not subtract the individual-level means from the
wave-level measures. This also changes the interpretation of the
between-subject coefficients: In the contextual model, they are the
\emph{difference} between the within and between effects. If there's no
difference between within and between effects, then, the coefficients will
be 0.

To fit a random effects model, use either \code{"between"} or \code{"random"}. This
involves no de-meaning and no individual-level means whatsoever.

To fit a fixed effects model, use either \code{"within"} or \code{"fixed"}. Any
between-subjects terms in the formula will be ignored. The time-varying
variables will be de-meaned, but the individual-level mean is not included
in the model.
